# CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) registration application using Laravel and Vue.js.

This repository contains a Vue.js frontend application built using Vite.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone <https://github.com/e-ramos18/fe-test.git>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open your application in the browser. The server automatically reloads the page whenever you make changes to the source code.

## Build

To build the production-ready optimized version of your application, run the following command:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` directory containing the bundled and minified files for your application.

## Deploy

To deploy your application to a production environment, you can use the files generated in the `dist` directory. Copy these files to your desired hosting server or deploy them using a hosting service of your choice.

## Customize Configuration

If you need to customize the configuration of your Vite project, you can modify the `vite.config.js` file. This file contains various settings and options for your application, including plugins, build options, and server configuration.
